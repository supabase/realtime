This repository focuses on version 2 but you can still access the previous version's [code](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/tree/v1) and [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/supabase/realtime/v1.0.0/images/sha256-e2766e0e3b0d03f7e9aa1b238286245697d0892c2f6f192fd2995dca32a4446a). For the latest Docker images go to https://hub.docker.com/r/supabase/realtime.

The codebase is under heavy development and the documentation is constantly evolving. Give it a try and let us know what you think by creating an issue. Watch [releases](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/releases) of this repo to get notified of updates. And give us a star if you like it!

## Overview

### What is this?

This is a server built with Elixir using the [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org) that enables the following functionality:

- Broadcast: Send ephemeral messages from client to clients with low latency.
- Presence: Track and synchronize shared state between clients.
- Postgres Changes: Listen to Postgres database changes and send them to authorized clients.

For a more detailed overview head over to [Realtime guides](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime).

### Does this server guarantee message delivery?

The server does not guarantee that every message will be delivered to your clients so keep that in mind as you're using Realtime.

## Quick start

You can check out the [Multiplayer demo](https://multiplayer.dev) that features Broadcast, Presence and Postgres Changes under the demo directory: https://github.com/supabase/realtime/tree/main/demo.

## Client libraries

- JavaScript: [@supabase/realtime-js](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js)
- Dart: [@supabase/realtime-dart](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-dart)

## Server Setup

To get started, spin up your Postgres database and Realtime server containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`. As an example, you may run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`.

> **Note**
> Supabase runs Realtime in production with a separate database that keeps track of all tenants. However, a schema, `_realtime`, is created when spinning up containers via `docker-compose.yml` to simplify local development.

A tenant has already been added on your behalf. You can confirm this by checking the `_realtime.tenants` and `_realtime.extensions` tables inside the database.

You can add your own by making a `POST` request to the server. You must change both `name` and `external_id` while you may update other values as you see fit:

```bash
  curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIiLCJpYXQiOjE2NzEyMzc4NzMsImV4cCI6MTcwMjc3Mzk5MywiYXVkIjoiIiwic3ViIjoiIn0._ARixa2KFUVsKBf3UGR90qKLCpGjxhKcXY4akVbmeNQ' \
  -d $'{
    "tenant" : {
      "name": "realtime-dev",
      "external_id": "realtime-dev",
      "jwt_secret": "a1d99c8b-91b6-47b2-8f3c-aa7d9a9ad20f",
      "extensions": [
        {
          "type": "postgres_cdc_rls",
          "settings": {
            "db_name": "postgres",
            "db_host": "host.docker.internal",
            "db_user": "postgres",
            "db_password": "postgres",
            "db_port": "5432",
            "region": "us-west-1",
            "poll_interval_ms": 100,
            "poll_max_record_bytes": 1048576
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }' \
  http://localhost:4000/api/tenants
```

> **Note**
> The `Authorization` token is signed with the secret set by `API_JWT_SECRET` in `docker-compose.yml`.

If you want to listen to Postgres changes, you can create a table and then add the table to the `supabase_realtime` publication:

```sql
create table test (
  id serial primary key
);

alter publication supabase_realtime add table test;
```

You can start playing around with Broadcast, Presence, and Postgres Changes features either with the client libs (e.g. `@supabase/realtime-js`), or use the built in Realtime Inspector on localhost, `http://localhost:4000/inspector/new` (make sure the port is correct for your development environment).

The WebSocket URL must contain the subdomain, `external_id` of the tenant on the `_realtime.tenants` table, and the token must be signed with the `jwt_secret` that was inserted along with the tenant.

If you're using the default tenant, the URL is `ws://realtime-dev.localhost:4000/socket` (make sure the port is correct for your development environment), and you can use `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MDMwMjgwODcsInJvbGUiOiJwb3N0Z3JlcyJ9.tz_XJ89gd6bN8MBpCl7afvPrZiBH6RB65iA1FadPT3Y` for the token. The token must have `exp` and `role` (database role) keys.

```

## WebSocket URL

The WebSocket URL is in the following format for local development: `ws://[external_id].localhost:4000/socket/websocket`

If you're using Supabase's hosted Realtime in production the URL is `wss://[project-ref].supabase.co/realtime/v1/websocket?apikey=[anon-token]&log_level=info&vsn=1.0.0"`

## WebSocket Connection Authorization

WebSocket connections are authorized via symmetric JWT verification. Only supports JWTs signed with the following algorithms:

- HS256
- HS384
- HS512

Verify JWT claims by setting JWT_CLAIM_VALIDATORS:

> e.g. {'iss': 'Issuer', 'nbf': 1610078130}
>
> Then JWT's "iss" value must equal "Issuer" and "nbf" value must equal 1610078130.

**Note:**

> JWT expiration is checked automatically. `exp` and `role` (database role) keys are mandatory.

**Authorizing Client Connection**: You can pass in the JWT by following the instructions under the Realtime client lib. For example, refer to the **Usage** section in the [@supabase/realtime-js](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js) client library.
