## Hiring

Supabase is hiring an Elixir expert to work full-time on this repo. If you have the experience, get in touch.

## Status

- [x] Alpha: Under heavy development
- [x] Public Alpha: Ready for use. But go easy on us, there may be a few kinks.
- [x] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases
- [ ] Public: Production-ready

This repo is still under heavy development and the documentation is evolving. You're welcome to try it, but expect some breaking changes. Watch "releases" of this repo to get notified of major updates. And give us a star if you like it!

## Example

```js
import { Socket } = '@supabase/realtime-js'

var socket = new Socket(process.env.REALTIME_URL)
socket.connect()

// Listen to all changes to user ID 99
var allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:public:users:id.eq.99')
  .join()
  .on('*', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })

// Listen to only INSERTS on the 'users' table in the 'public' schema
var allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:public:users')
  .join()
  .on('INSERT', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })

// Listen to all updates from the 'public' schema
var allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:public')
  .join()
  .on('UPDATE', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })

// Listen to all changes in the database
let allChanges = this.socket.channel('realtime:*')
  .join()
  .on('*', payload => { console.log('Update received!', payload) })

```

## Introduction

#### What is this?

This is an Elixir server (Phoenix) that allows you to listen to changes in your database via websockets.

It works like this:

1. the Phoenix server listens to PostgreSQL's replication functionality (using Postgres' logical decoding)
2. it converts the byte stream into JSON
3. it then broadcasts over websockets.

#### Cool, but why not just use Postgres' `NOTIFY`?

A few reasons:

1. You don't have to set up triggers on every table
2. NOTIFY has a payload limit of 8000 bytes and will fail for anything larger. The usual solution is to send an ID then fetch the record, but that's heavy on the database
3. This server consumes one connection to the database, then you can connect many clients to this server. Easier on your database, and to scale up you just add realtime servers

#### What are the benefits?

1. The beauty of listening to the replication functionality is that you can make changes to your database from anywhere - your API, directly in the DB, via a console etc - and you will still receive the changes via websockets.
2. Decoupling. For example, if you want to send a new slack message every time someone makes a new purchase you might build that functionality directly into your API. This allows you to decouple your async functionality from your API.
3. This is built with Phoenix, an [extremely scalable Elixir framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections)


## Quick start

We have set up some simple examples that show how to use this server:

- [Next.js example](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/tree/master/examples/next-js)
- [NodeJS example](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/tree/master/examples/node-js)


## Client libraries

- Javascript: [@supabase/realtime-js](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js)


## Server

### Database set up

There are a some requirements for your database

1. It must be Postgres 10+ as it uses logical replication
2. Set up your DB for replication
   1. it must have the `wal_level` set to logical. You can check this by running `SHOW wal_level;`. To set the `wal_level`, you can call `ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;`
   2. You must set `max_replication_slots` to at least 1: `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 5;`
3. Create a `PUBLICATION` for this server to listen to: `CREATE PUBLICATION supabase_realtime FOR ALL TABLES;`
4. [OPTIONAL] If you want to receive the old record (previous values) on UPDATE and DELETE, you can set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` like this: `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`. This has to be set for each table unfortunately.

### Server set up

The easiest way to get started is just to use our docker image. We will add more deployment methods soon.

```sh
# Update the environment variables to point to your own database
docker run \
  -e DB_HOST='docker.for.mac.host.internal' \
  -e DB_NAME='postgres' \
  -e DB_USER='postgres' \
  -e DB_PASSWORD='postgres' \
  -e DB_PORT=5432 \
  -e PORT=4000 \
  -e HOSTNAME='localhost' \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE='SOMETHING_SUPER_SECRET' \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  supabase/realtime
```

**OPTIONS**

```sh
DB_HOST       # {string} Database host URL
DB_NAME       # {string} Postgres database name
DB_USER       # {string} Database user
DB_PASSWORD   # {string} Database password
DB_PORT       # {number} Database port
SLOT_NAME     # {string} A unique name for Postgres to track where this server has "listened until". If the server dies, it can pick up from the last position. This should be lowercase.
PORT          # {number} Port which you can connect your client/listeners
```
