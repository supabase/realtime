## Specific Techniques for SEL in Music Classrooms

### Elementary (Jessica Kwasny)

**Emoji Board Listening Activity**:
- Students work in pairs
- Each gets a board of 9 emojis
- Listen to 30-60 seconds of music
- Point to emoji representing their feelings
- Discuss with partner what in the music led to that feeling
- **SEL outcomes**: Emotional vocabulary, self-awareness, communication, empathy

**Group Norms**:
- Treat instruments carefully
- Be responsible
- Let everyone give ideas
- Be kind to others
- **SEL outcomes**: Relationship skills, social awareness

**Classroom Environment**:
- Posters: "You are believed in, cared for, listened to, important, loved, respected, valued"
- **SEL outcomes**: Sense of belonging, self-worth

### Middle School (William Winters)

**Goal Sharing**:
- Students discuss goals with each other (musical and non-musical)
- Teacher participates too
- **SEL outcomes**: Self-awareness, relationship building, communication

**Emotion Exploration**:
- Listen to music without knowing the title
- Reflect on emotions felt
- Put music into words and images
- **SEL outcomes**: Emotional vocabulary, self-awareness, creative expression

**Leadership Rotation**:
- All students get opportunity to lead (captain and crew analogy)
- Peers give constructive feedback to leaders
- **SEL outcomes**: Leadership skills, giving/receiving feedback, responsibility

**Choice and Reflection**:
- Students propose changes to music (tempo, dynamics, etc.)
- Try changes, evaluate if they improved the original
- Reflect on why composer made original choices
- **SEL outcomes**: Decision-making, critical thinking, empathy

### High School (Brandon Larsen)

**Culture of Caring**:
- Call-and-response mottoes: "We leave this bus... cleaner than we found it"
- "We hope they... play as well as we do" (wishing competitors well)
- **SEL outcomes**: Character, ambassadorship, sportsmanship

**Life Story Presentations**:
- Students create slide show about their life
- Add soundtrack of their choice
- Present to group, take questions
- **SEL outcomes**: Self-expression, vulnerability, connection, empathy

**Check-in Fist to Five**:
- Used musically (rate performance, style, togetherness)
- Used emotionally (how are you feeling right now?)
- **SEL outcomes**: Self-monitoring, emotional awareness, self-assessment

**Resilience Through Music**:
- Music learning as vehicle for learning to fail, improve, and bounce back
- Coping and emotion management strategies
- **SEL outcomes**: Resilience, growth mindset, emotional regulation

## Why Collaborative Music-Making is Ideal for SEL

### Inherent SEL Opportunities

1. **Interdependence**: In ensemble, your actions affect everyone
2. **Real-time feedback**: You hear immediately if you're out of sync
3. **Shared goals**: Everyone working toward the same performance
4. **Emotional expression**: Music is a natural vehicle for feelings
5. **Safe space for mistakes**: Errors are expected and part of learning
6. **Multiple roles**: Everyone contributes differently (melody, harmony, rhythm)
7. **Non-verbal communication**: Listening, watching, responding without words

### Research-Backed Benefits

From Váradi (2022) review (230 citations):
- Music education in **group settings** enhances socio-emotional development
- Collaborative music-making develops **empathy**, **cooperation**, and **social skills**
- Group music experiences create **sense of belonging** and **community**

From Cores-Bilbao et al. (2019):
- Music-mediated learning experiences imply **socio-emotional change**
- Students become more aware of their **socio-emotional skills** through music

## Critical Design Principles for SEL Music Games

Based on research, a collaborative music game for kids should:

### 1. **Embed SEL, Don't Add It On**
- SEL should happen **through** music-making, not as separate lessons
- Make SEL implicit in game mechanics, not explicit lectures

### 2. **Create Safe Space for Expression**
- Mistakes are expected and part of the game
- No punishment for "wrong notes"
- Focus on exploration and creativity

### 3. **Build in Reflection**
- Opportunities to self-assess (how did I do?)
- Opportunities to reflect on emotions (how did that make me feel?)
- Opportunities to give/receive feedback

### 4. **Enable Multiple Roles**
- Not everyone plays the same part
- Leadership rotates (who sets tempo, who starts, etc.)
- Different instruments/voices contribute differently

### 5. **Make Interdependence Clear**
- Players can hear how they affect each other
- Success requires coordination, not just individual skill
- Visual/audio feedback shows connection between players

### 6. **Support Emotional Vocabulary**
- Help kids name what they're feeling
- Connect musical elements to emotions
- Use emojis, colors, words to express feelings

### 7. **Encourage Choice and Agency**
- Players make musical decisions (tempo, dynamics, instrument)
- Players can propose changes and try them out
- Players set their own goals

### 8. **Foster Positive Social Norms**
- Establish group agreements (be kind, let everyone contribute)
- Model constructive feedback
- Celebrate each other's successes

## Specific SEL Outcomes for Synchronous Music Game

### What Kids Should Learn/Experience

**Self-Awareness**:
- "I can recognize when I'm playing too loud/soft/fast/slow"
- "I know which instruments I like and why"
- "I can tell how I'm feeling through music"

**Self-Management**:
- "I can stay in tempo even when it's hard"
- "I can handle making a mistake without quitting"
- "I can practice to improve my skills"

**Social Awareness**:
- "I can hear when others are playing and adjust to them"
- "I understand how my playing affects the group"
- "I can recognize emotions in others' music"

**Relationship Skills**:
- "I can work with others to create music together"
- "I can give helpful feedback to my classmates"
- "I can ask for help when I need it"

**Responsible Decision-Making**:
- "I can choose appropriate dynamics/tempo for the music"
- "I can decide how to improve our group performance"
- "I can follow group norms and agreements"

## Implications for Game Design

### Game Mechanics That Support SEL

1. **Turn-taking with leadership**: Each player gets to be "conductor" for a round
2. **Emoji/emotion feedback**: After each round, players share how they felt
3. **Group goal-setting**: Before playing, group decides on a goal (play together, play expressively, etc.)
4. **Mistake recovery**: Game mechanics that allow players to help each other recover from errors
5. **Visual connection**: Players can see each other (avatars, video) to build social connection
6. **Reflection prompts**: "What went well? What could we improve? How did you feel?"
7. **Celebration moments**: Game celebrates group achievements, not just individual scores
8. **Choice architecture**: Players choose instruments, parts, tempo, etc.

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Competitive scoring**: Don't pit players against each other  
❌ **Punishment for mistakes**: Don't make errors feel bad  
❌ **Forced participation**: Allow players to observe/listen sometimes  
❌ **One-size-fits-all**: Don't force everyone to play the same way  
❌ **Teacher-only control**: Give students agency and choice  
❌ **Isolation**: Don't make it feel like single-player with others present  
❌ **Complexity overload**: Don't make it so hard that kids feel frustrated
